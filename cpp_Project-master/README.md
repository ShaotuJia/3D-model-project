# cpp_Project
This is the project repository for the Spring 2016 C++ Engineering Program class. 
The project is to generate 3D models using Qt and C++ utilizing QOpenGL. 
The end goal of the project is to create .STL files of the 3D models produced for creation using a 3D Printer.
Other features can be added such as calculating 3D model volumes etc etc ...
Generate3DSTL folder is the programming codes.
Three Debug files are used for software testing in different OS.
STL and STL%20 folder are several 3D model examples but not every model. 
"3D Model using Analytic Shape" is the final presentation PPTs.
